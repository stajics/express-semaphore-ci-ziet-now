# Semaphore demo CI/CD pipeline using Express

Example application and CI/CD pipeline showing how to run a JavaScript Express.js project
on Semaphore 2.0. Project consists of a Express.js server. Code is written in JavaScript.

## CI/CD on Semaphore

1. Fork this repository and use it to [create a
project](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/63-your-first-project).

2. Go to your Now dashboard, and [add a token](https://zeit.co/account/tokens). You should see a slightly hidden field in the middle of the page that says "Create a new token by entering its name..." I'd recommend calling it something obvious like `zeit-now-semaphoreci-yourproject`.

3. Take the token, and create an Secret and add an Environment Variable in your project's configuration in SemaphoreCI. This sample repo calls the Secret `now` and Environment Variable `ZEIT_TOKEN`, ![CI pipeline on Semaphore](images/new-secret.png) so I'd suggest doing the same - if you change it, be aware that you'll need to change references to this token name in the sample files.

The CI pipeline will look like this:

The example pipeline contains 3 blocks:

 - Install dependencies
    -  installs and caches all npm dependencies
 - Run tests
    - Runs Tests using Jest framework (https://jestjs.io/)
 - Deply
    - Deploys the server using Zeist Now (https://zeit.co/now)
